Bako is a local-first, single-screen desktop POS built with **Tauri 2 + React 19 + TypeScript**. The UI runs on Vite and persists data locally in **SQLite** through `@tauri-apps/plugin-sql` and **Drizzle ORM**. No routing, no backend — everything runs on the machine where it's installed.

> **Note:** The checkout flow is local-only; it does not integrate a real payment gateway.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/norman404/bako.git
cd bako

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run in development (web only)
bun run dev

# Run as desktop app (Tauri)
bun run tauri dev
```

> **Versioning:** Bako releases use CalVer `YY.M.x` (two-digit year.month.release-of-the-month), tagged as `vYY.M.x`.

## Development

### Scripts

| Command              | Description                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run dev`        | Start Vite dev server (web only)             |
| `bun run build`      | Type-check and build for production (`tsc` + `vite build`) |
| `bun run preview`    | Preview the production build locally         |
| `bun run tauri dev`  | Run as a Tauri desktop app (development)     |
| `bun run tauri build`| Build the desktop app for production         |
| `bun run test`       | Run tests (`bun:test` via `scripts/run-tests.ts`) |
| `bun run test:node`  | Run unit tests (`.spec.ts`)                  |
| `bun run test:dom`   | Run DOM tests (`.dom.spec.tsx` + happy-dom)  |

### Workflow

- **TDD** — every change follows the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle: write the failing test first, then the minimum code to pass it, then refactor.
- **Clean Architecture** — the codebase is organized by feature (vertical slices), keeping the domain independent of frameworks and persistence.
- See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the full architecture guide, module conventions, and the canonical reference module (`menu`).

---

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture by module

Each module in `src/modules/` is a self-contained vertical slice with internal layers. Dependencies always point inward — the domain never imports from persistence, hooks, or components.

```
domain/ (entities + ports) ← use-cases ← persistence
                                 ↑
                               hooks  (inject persistence, call use-cases)
                                 ↑
                             components  (UI only, receive callbacks)
```

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the detailed layering rules and the `menu` module reference.

### Plugin/Registry pattern

Each module is autonomous. To appear in the settings panel, it declares its own `manifest.ts`:

```typescript
// modules/my-module/manifest.ts
export const myModuleManifest: ModuleManifest = {
  id: "my-module",
  flagKey: "my_module_enabled", // optional — toggles the module via a feature flag
  settingsPanel: MyPanel,        // optional — settings screen
  settingsLabel: "My Module",
  settingsIcon: SomeIcon,
};
```

Then it is registered in `src/app/module-registry.ts`. `SettingsModal` knows nothing about any module — it iterates the registry dynamically.

### Directory structure

```txt
src/
├── app/
│   ├── App.tsx
│   └── module-registry.ts        ← central module registry
├── modules/
│   ├── checkout/
│   │   └── manifest.ts           ← module manifest
│   ├── feature-flags/

│   ├── stores/                   ← global UI Zustand stores
│   └── i18n/
└── main.tsx

src-tauri/
├── migrations/                   ← SQLite migrations (immutable once applied)
├── src/
├── Cargo.toml
└── tauri.conf.json
```

### Local database

Bako uses a local SQLite database named `bako.db`, initialized in `src/shared/db/`. Migrations are executed **exclusively by Tauri** at app startup (see `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) — there is no JavaScript/TypeScript migration runner.

---

## Testing

```bash
bun run test       # unit tests
bun run test:dom   # DOM tests
```

Tests are co-located with their implementation. Domain logic and use-cases are the easiest to test — they are pure functions with no React or database dependencies.
